    "The goal of this tutorial is to explore ways of doing **reproducible data science** in Python. It begins with a brief discussion of recent history and theory around reproducibility to motivate why it is important and what the benefits are. As reproducibility has gained importance, many tools have started coming up to address this need. These tools are built on a shared set of technical building blocks, and we provide a cursory introduction to the building blocks for implementing reproducible data science in the second section. Finally, we conclude the theory section concludes with a short survey of the current landscape of tools.\n",
