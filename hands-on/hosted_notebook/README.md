2. Declare environment
3. Import data

# Creating a project

The first thing to do when starting a project is to initialize a project. This can most easily be done using the Renku web user interface. You can either create a project by initiating a new one or by forking an existing one. In this tutorial we will fork the `renku-tutorial-flights` repository.

- Log-in to https://renkulab.io/login
- Navigate to https://renkulab.io/projects/749/
- Fork the project by pressing the `fork` button in the upper right

Let us take a look at what's inside the renku project

# Working in the project

One way to work on a project is to create an interactive environment (notebook server).  
This is often the most convenient way to start a project and to collaborate with others because
you can easily specify all the software dependencies needed for the project to work. 

## Step 1: Start a new notebook server

## Step 2: Select options and launch the server

Take the default options and select `Launch Server`.

## Step 3: Connect to the server

Connect to the server from the `Running>Connect` contextual menu.

# Viewing contents of the project repository

The remainder of the tutorial runs on the hosted platform. You should go to the notebook 
`index.ipynb` in the base directory and follow the tutorial from there.
